# Medium- and large- mammal assessment of the Upper Berbice, Guyana

These data and code are part of a project to assess the populations of large- and medium-bodied mammals in the Upper Berbice Region of Guyana. It uses data collected in 2014 under a World Wildlife Fund-Guianas and Global Wildlife Conservation Rapid Assessment in partnership with Panthera. At the time I was Panthera's 2014-2015 Winston Cobb Memorial Fellow. 

Additionally, data were included from a separate project conducted in the same study area in 2016 to assess the impacts of roads on medium- and large mammals. This project was conducted by Panthera and funded by the Species without Borders Program of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

Further details on the methods employed, study design, and study site context can be found in the peer-reviewed article linked below.

Abstract:

> Large mammals are key contributors to forest ecosystems globally, but Neotropical mammal populations are understudied. We employed remotely triggered camera traps and track surveys to assess the mammal community in the newly accessible upper Berbice region of Guyana. In a cumulative 2,821 trap nights between two camps and 14 km of track surveys we recorded 18 species of mammals. Camera trap records showed that Red-Rumped Agouti (_Dasyprocta leporina_ (Linnaeus, 1758)) featured the highest relative abundance at both camps, while Tayra (_Eira barbara_ (Linnaeus, 1758)), Amazonian Brown Brocket Deer (_Mazama nemorivaga_ (F. Cuvier, 1817)), Giant Anteater (_Myrmecophaga tridactyla_ (Linnaeus, 1758)) and Giant Armadillo (_Priodontes maximus_ (Kerr, 1792)) the lowest. We also report naÃ¯ve occupancy estimates. Detections of threatened and disturbance sensitive species indicate that the study site has a high biodiversity value. We provide recommendations for further study in this recently disturbed ecosystem and other understudied regions of Guyana.

The data and code were included in the supplemental data for the Check List paper that we published. I plan to archive this data in a repository for long term storage after writing detailed metadata and Changelogs. As such this repository will continue to evolve and grow over time.

Notes:

- For now, please refer to the R code and manuscript for details on how to use the data. Any questions can be referred to me at: meshachpierre@gmail.com or mpierre2@ufl.edu
- Repository will be updated and finalized when metadata and changelog files are generated, and data are archived in a long term repository with a persistent digital object identifier (DOI)
- Expect changes to the folder structure, organization, and naming of files as the repository is organized and finalized. I do not expect that the data and scripts will change significantly, as they have already been published as is. Changes will be merely to help with the ease of access to those unfamiliar with the files and the project.
- If you do use these data, please cite our paper using the citation details above. Thank you!
